# MeSpotter - Personal Image Classification Project

## Project Overview

This sophisticated project exemplifies a blend of deep learning and computer vision techniques aimed at developing a high-precision classification model. The core functionality revolves around processing a collection of images to identify and segregate those that feature the developer, leveraging state-of-the-art face detection and classification algorithms. This endeavor not only highlights technical acumen in machine learning model development but also practical skills in automating the organization of digital assets.

### Final Goal

This system is ingeniously designed to automate the sorting of a vast array of photos, identifying the presence of the developer in each image. Upon receiving the path to a folder filled with photos, the system meticulously analyzes, detects, and classifies faces, ultimately copying photos that include the developer into a newly created folder. This process exemplifies an innovative approach to personal digital content management.
